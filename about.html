      <p>
        This experiment is designed to gather data about participants’ trust decisions.
        You will be asked to fill out a short pre-survey (including your name and email),
        then read through 20 scenarios where you decide whether to trust the information
        or not. Finally, you'll be asked to complete a post-survey.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you finish, a CSV file named after you (e.g., <strong>John_Smith.csv</strong>)
        will be downloaded automatically. Please send this file to the researcher if requested.
