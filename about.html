Thank you for your interest in our study, where we examine how clinicians interact with AI-driven medical recommendations. 
</P>
</P>
In this experiment, we use an AI Clinical Decision Support (CDS) platform—powered by a Large Language Model (LLM)—that helps clinicians make better decisions by offering draft recommendations.
</P>
</P>
In this experiment you expect to engage in answering a demographich questionnaire, analyzing some clinical scenarios and diagnosis provided by AI which you can trust or not trust, providing your feed back on the scenario if you did not trust the AI, give feed back on AI diagnosis, and a post-experiment survey. Your answer will save on the server autonomosly after you finish the experiment/ 
</P>
</P>
our participation will help us understand how clinicians evaluate and trust AI-generated medical predictions. We appreciate your time and insights, as they will contribute to improving the design and reliability of AI Clinical Decision Support systems for healthcare professionals.
